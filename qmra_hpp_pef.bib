	abstract = {The survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in acidic foods and its enhanced survival in refrigerated acid foods are well documented. This prompted the present study to evaluate the growth potential of E. coli O157:H7 in fresh tropical fruit juices. The pH of the various juices ranged between 3.57 (pineapple) and 6.2 (avocado). Samples were separately inoculated with a mixture of four E. coli O157:H7 strains at initial levels of approximately 103 cfu/ml, and stored at refrigeration (4°C) and ambient (20–25°C) temperatures for 120 h. In pineapple juice, some decline in count was noted during ambient temperature storage but complete inhibition was not observed. At refrigeration temperature, the test strains survived without a noticeable decline in number. The pH remained unchanged throughout the experiment at both incubation temperatures. In papaya and avocado juices, counts of the test strains increased at varying rates at both storage temperatures. A decrease in pH was also noted in the stored juice. This study demonstrated that E. coli O157:H7 can survive well in acidic pineapple juice at both incubation temperatures and could also grow luxuriously in fruit juices with relatively higher pH values ({\textgreater}5.7) when stored at ambient and refrigeration temperatures.},

	abstract = {The inactivation of Escherichia coli is one of the major issues in the food industry. The present study focuses on the application of a combined microwave-ultrasound system for the optimization of the inactivation of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 in an orange juice drink. Using response surface methodology (RSM), trials were planned with a Box–Behnken Design (BBD) to maximize the impact of microwave power (A: 300–900 W), microwave treatment time (B: 15–35 s), and time of ultrasound (C: 10–30 min) on E. coli inactivation. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out and E. coli inactivation was expressed with a mathematical equation depending on the factors. The results showed that both the microwave treatment time and the time of ultrasound were effective as independent variables in eliminating the E. coli strain. However, the effect of these two variables, ultrasound and microwave exposure time, in combination was significantly greater than when examined separately. RSM modeling determined that optimal treatment conditions include 900 W microwave power, 33 s microwave treatment time, and 20 min time of ultrasound to achieve an 8-log reduction of E. coli, constituting total inactivation. The results of this study showed that ultrasound-microwave treatment is a potential alternative processing method for an orange juice beverage.},

Study 1 was conducted with a mixture of four E. coli O157:H7 strains grown (35 °C, 24 h) in tryptic soy broth (TSB). Study 2 was conducted with the same mixture of four E. coli O157:H7 strains grown (35 °C, 24 h) in glucose-free TSB with 1\% added glucose (final pH 4.83), or in diluted lactic acid meat decontamination runoff fluids (washings; final pH 4.92), or nonadapted cultures prepared in glucose-free TSB (final pH 6.45), or in water washings (final pH 6.87). Parameters included incubation temperature (10–35 °C), pH (3.52–7.32), and NaCl concentration (0–10\% w/v). Growth responses were evaluated for 60 days turbidimetrically (610 nm) every 5 days in 160 (study 1) and 360 (study 2) combinations in quadruplicate samples, with a microplate reader. The lower the initial inoculum the higher were the minimum pH and aw values permitting growth. Differences in the pH and aw growth limits among inoculum concentrations increased at 15 and 10 °C. Acid-adapted cultures were able to grow at lower pH than nonadapted cultures, while at temperatures below 25 °C, growth initiation of nonadapted cultures stopped at higher aw compared to acid-adapted cultures for the whole pH range of 3.52 to 7.32. A comparison with available data indicated that our model for acid-adapted E. coli O157:H7 in different environments may provide representative growth probabilities covering both nonadapted and stress-adapted contaminants.},

	abstract = {Thermal inactivation of pathogens has been studied extensively, which has resulted in a wide range of D- and z-values. Estimating the inactivation rate for a specific condition based on these reported values is difficult, since one has to select representative conditions, and data obtained exactly at the required representative conditions are generally not available. Therefore, a first step could be to globally assess a heat treatment taking into account largest effects only. Once the most important parameters are known, a more precise study of inactivation can be performed. Therefore, in this study a large quantity of D-values (n=4066) was collected from literature for various pathogens and linear regression was applied to obtain average D-values (together with the 95\% upper prediction level) and z-values. When comparing these overall data, it can be seen that most factors reported to have an effect on the D-value are smaller than the variability of all published D-values. Even effects of shoulders disappear in the overall analysis. Only a limited number of factors that did have a significant effect (p{\textless}0.05) on the D-value were identified: for Salmonella spp., the presence of chocolate ingredients gave protection to the cells, for Listeria monocytogenes the presence of 10\% salt (or aw{\textless}0.92) resulted in a higher heat resistance, for Bacillus cereus there were significant differences for various strains and in oily products and for Clostridium botulinum there were significant differences in heat resistance between different types of C. botulinum. This does not mean that other effects do not occur, but it shows the main effects that have to be included for a first impression on the performance of a heating process. The obtained 95\% upper prediction levels of the D-values can be used as a (conservative) estimate of inactivation and can be used to give order of magnitude values in overall process evaluations.},

Alternative technologies have been investigated already for their potential to overcome the negative impacts of thermal treatments and improve existing processes for many years. Following significant research and technological achievements, pulsed electric fields (PEF) technology is one of the most investigated and prominent technologies that has been successfully introduced in the industrial environment. Many different applications in food processing as well as in biotechnology, pharmacy, and medicine have been identified. However, the major PEF application so far is in the potato industry, but many past and ongoing studies are paving the way for new applications in different fields. Although PEF technology is operating in the industry for several years, and many PEF products exist on the market, its environmental benefits or drawbacks are not completely uncovered. So far there are very few LCA studies investigating the environmental impacts of PEF technology for preservation of juices or peeling of tomatoes. On the other hand, for PEF applications for softening the potato tissue, LCA studies are completely missing, and advantages are driven by energy savings and cost reduction.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the heat resistance of individual strain of stationary phase non-adapted and acid adapted STEC, Salmonella spp., and L. monocytogenes in orange juice. Three STEC and Salmonella isolates were grown in TSB, and three L. monocytogenes strains grown in BHI, supplemented with 1\% glucose for acid adaption. Sealed microcapillary tubes with inoculated single-strength pasteurized orange juice without pulp were treated at 56, 58, and 60 °C for STEC and L. monocytogenes and at 55, 58, and 60 °C for Salmonella. Thermal tolerance was increased significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) for acid adapted STEC strains, however, no improvement was observed for Salmonella spp., and L. monocytogenes strains at most temperatures tested. Salmonella serotypes are less heat resistant, at all temperatures tested, than L. monocytogenes and STEC. STEC, especially strain O111, are the most heat resistant at 56 and 58 °C; L. monocytogenes strains are the most thermal tolerance at 60 °C. Combining individual results of all pathogens tested, the formula of log D = 8.2167 − 0.1356 T(°C) was used to calculate a general process for orange juice at 71.1 °C. Using this equation, a 5-log reduction of all three pathogens in single strength orange juice requires 11 s at 71.1 °C, with a z-value of 7.1 °C.},

	abstract = {Contaminated food continues to be the principal vehicle for transmission of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and other Shiga toxin–producing E. coli (STEC) to humans. A large number of foods, including those associated with outbreaks (alfalfa sprouts, fresh produce, beef, and unpasteurized juices), have been the focus of intensive research studies in the past few years (2003 to 2006) to assess the prevalence and identify effective intervention and inactivation treatments for these pathogens. Recent analyses of retail foods in the United States revealed E. coli O157:H7 was present in 1.5\% of alfalfa sprouts and 0.17\% of ground beef but not in some other foods examined. Differences in virulence patterns (presence of both stx1 and stx2 genes versus one stx gene) have been observed among isolates from beef samples obtained at the processing plant compared with retail outlets. Research has continued to examine survival and growth of STEC in foods, with several models being developed to predict the behavior of the pathogen under a wide range of environmental conditions. In an effort to develop effective strategies to minimize contamination, several influential factors are being addressed, including elucidating the underlying mechanism for attachment and penetration of STEC into foods and determining the role of handling practices and processing operations on cross-contamination between foods. Reports of some alternative nonthermal processing treatments (high pressure, pulsed-electric field, ionizing radiation, UV radiation, and ultrasound) indicate potential for inactivating STEC with minimal alteration to sensory and nutrient characteristics. Antimicrobials (e.g., organic acids, oxidizing agents, cetylpyridinium chloride, bacteriocins, acidified sodium chlorite, natural extracts) have varying degrees of efficacy as preservatives or sanitizing agents on produce, meat, and unpasteurized juices. Multiple-hurdle or sequential intervention treatments have the greatest potential to minimize transmission of STEC in foods.},

	abstract = {Outbreaks of foodborne illness resulting from consumption of contaminated fresh juices continue to occur worldwide. Between 1974 and 2014, fresh juices were involved in at least 48 foodborne illness outbreaks involving bacteria (. Salmonella, Shigella flexneri, Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli including groups O157 and O111 STEC, and enterotoxigenic E. coli), viruses (norovirus genotype II, hepatitis A virus), or protozoa (. Cryptosporidium and Trypanosoma cruzi) as etiologic agents. Most of these outbreaks were linked to fresh-squeezed orange or apple juice, while outbreaks caused by T. cruzi were linked to fresh juice made from various exotic fruits. The sources of pathogens causing outbreaks in fresh-squeezed juice include animal feces contaminating the raw fruits or vegetables used for juice making, contaminated water used in the process, unsanitary equipment and utensils used in juice extraction and serving, and food handlers. These pathogens may be internalized into the fruits used to obtain juice, and survive despite the natural acidity of some fruit juices. Therefore, more effective strategies for reducing pathogens potentially present in fresh-squeezed juices should be applied. These strategies include the use of nondamaged raw materials, implementation of Good Manufacturing Practices during processing, and the implementation of an HACCP plan when possible. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, the efficacy of two preservatives, 0.1\% sodium benzoate and 0.1\% potassium sorbate, used separately and in combination was evaluated for antimicrobial effects on the bacterium. Studies were done at 8 or 25 degrees C with ciders having pH values of 3.6 to 4.0. The results revealed that E. coli O157:H7 populations increased slightly (ca. 1 log10 CFU/ml) and then remained stable for approximately 12 days in lots inoculated with an initial population of 10(5) E. coli O157:H7 organisms per ml and held at 8 degrees C. The bacterium survived from 10 to 31 days or 2 to 3 days at 8 or 25 degrees C, respectively, depending on the lot. Potassium sorbate had minimal effect on E. coli O157:H7 populations, with survivors detected for 15 to 20 days or 1 to 3 days at 8 or 25 degrees C, respectively. In contrast, survivors in cider containing sodium benzoate were detected for only 2 to 10 days or less than 1 to 2 days at 8 or 25 degrees C, respectively. The highest rates of inactivation occurred in the presence of a combination of 0.1\% sodium benzoate and 0.1\% potassium sorbate. The use of 0.1\% sodium benzoate, an approved preservative used by some cider processors, will substantially increase the safety of apple cider in terms of E. coli O157:H7, in addition to suppressing the growth of yeasts and molds.},

	abstract = {Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) is a methodology used to organize and analyze scientific information to estimate the probability and severity of an adverse event. Applied to microbial food safety, the methodology can also help to identify those stages in the manufacture, distribution, handling, and consumption of foods that contribute to an increased risk of foodborne illness, and help focus resources and efforts to most effectively reduce the risk of foodborne pathogens. The term Process Risk Model (PRM) is introduced in this paper to describe the integration and application of QRA methodology with scenario analysis and predictive microbiology to provide an objective assessment of the hygienic characteristics of a manufacturing process. The methodology was applied to model the human health risk associated with Escherichia coli O157:H7 in ground beef hamburgers. The PRM incorporated two mathematical submodels; the first was intended to described the behaviour of the pathogen from the production of the food through processing, handling, and consumption to predict human exposure. The exposure estimate was then used as input to a dose–response model to estimate the health risk associated with consuming food from the process. Monte Carlo simulation was used to assess the effect of the uncertainty and variability in the model parameters on the predicted human health risk. The model predicted a probability of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome of 3.7×10−6 and a probability of mortality of 1.9×10−7 per meal for the very young. These estimates are likely high for all hamburger meals, but may be reasonable for the home-prepared hamburgers described by this model. The efficacy of three risk mitigation strategies were evaluated by modifying the values of the predictive factors and comparing the new predicted risk. The average probability of illness was predicted to be reduced by 80\% under a hypothetical mitigation strategy directed at reducing microbial growth during retail storage through a reduction in storage temperature. This strategy was predicted to be more effective than a hypothetical intervention which estimated a plausible reduction in the concentration of E. coli O157:H7 in the feces of cattle shedding the pathogen and one aimed at convincing consumers to cook hamburgers more thoroughly. The conclusions of this approach are only accurate to the extent that the model accurately represents the process. Currently, uncertainty and ignorance about the hygienic effects of the individual operations during production, processing, and handling limit the applicability of a PRM to specify HACCP criteria in a quantitative manner. However, with continuous improvement through stimulated research, a PRM should encompass all available information about the process, food, and pathogen and should be the most appropriate decision-support tool since it represents current knowledge.},

	abstract = {Fresh apples are expected to have a minimal risk of causing foodborne illness from Escherichia coli O157:H7 because of their low pH and refrigerated storage under modified atmosphere. To assess this expectation, improve understanding of the various factors that contribute to risk, and identify potential risk management improvements to maintain low risk a quantitative risk assessment model was developed to estimate the risk of illness from Australian apples throughout the apple supply chain. The model incorporated orchard conditions, proportion of apples damaged, effects of storage time and temperature on pathogen survival through the supply chain, and orchard and packhouse activities that affect contamination levels. The model was constructed in Analytica® with uncertainty in predictions modelled through use of 150,000 (5 × 30,000) iterations. Alternative scenarios of orchard management practices, wash water controls, equipment cleaning, and verification activities were examined using current Australian harvest guidelines and water washing as a baseline. The mean risk of illness from E. coli O157:H7 after consuming fresh Australian apples was estimated to be 1.43 × 10−10 per serving (min. 0, max. 1.21 × 10−6) or approximately one illness per 10 billion apples consumed. Under a scenario with conservative (i.e., worst-case) assumptions, one case of E. coli O157:H7 illness every five years, caused by fresh apples in Australia was predicted. Sensitivity analyses indicated that wash water control, removal of damaged fruit, and prevention of cross-contamination were the most crucial factors affecting the predicted number of illnesses. Despite the adoption of several conservative assumptions to fill identified data gaps, it is predicted that Australian apples have a low probability of causing foodborne illness. Nonetheless, this risk assessment will assist industry to reinforce risk management best practices for risk mitigations against E. coli on apples.},

	abstract = {Outbreaks of foodborne illness from apple cider have prompted research on the survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in this food. Published results vary widely, potentially due to differences in E. coli O157:H7 strains, enumeration media, and other experimental considerations. We developed probability distribution functions for the change in concentration of E. coli O157:H7 (log CFU/day) in cider using data from scientific publications for use in a quantitative risk assessment. Six storage conditions (refrigeration [4 to 5°C]; temperature abuse [6 to 10°C]; room temperature [20 to 25°C]; refrigerated with 0.1\% sodium benzoate, 0.1\% potassium sorbate, or both) were modeled. E. coli survival rate data for all three unpreserved cider storage conditions were highly peaked, and these data were fit to logistic distributions: ideal refrigeration, logistic (−0.061, 0.13); temperature abuse, logistic (−0.0982, 0.23); room temperature, logistic (−0.1, 0.29) and uniform (−4.3, −1.8), to model the very small chance of extremely high log CFU reductions. There were fewer published studies on refrigerated, preserved cider, and these smaller data sets were modeled with beta (4.27, 2.37) × 2.2 − 1.6, normal (−0.2, 0.13), and gamma (1.45, 0.6) distributions, respectively. Simulations were run to show the effect of storage on E. coli O157:H7 during the shelf life of apple cider. Under every storage condition, with and without preservatives, there was an overall decline in E. coli O157:H7 populations in cider, although a small fraction of the time a slight increase was seen.},

	abstract = {Quantitative descriptions of the frequency and extent of contamination of apple cider with pathogenic bacteria were obtained using literature data and computer simulation. Probability distributions were chosen to describe the risk of apple contamination by each suspected pathway. Tree-picked apples may be contaminated by birds infected with Escherichia coli O157:H7 when orchards were located near a sewage source (ocean or landfill). Dropped apples could become contaminated from either infected animal droppings or from contaminated manure if used as fertilizer. A risk assessment model was created in Analytica. The results of worst-case simulations revealed that 6–9 log CFU E. coli O157:H7 might be found on a harvest of 1000 dropped apples, while 3–4 log CFU contamination could be present on 1000 tree-picked apples. This model confirms that practices such as using dropped apples and using animal waste as fertilizer increase risk in the production of apple cider, and that pasteurization may not eliminate all contamination in juice from heavily contaminated fruit. Recently published FDA regulations for juices requiring a 5-log CFU/ml reduction of pathogenic bacteria in fresh juices should be a fail–safe measure for apples harvested in all but the worst-case scenarios.},

	abstract = {The effect of bactericidal UV-C treatments (254 nm) on Escherichia coli O157:H7 suspended in apple juice increased synergistically with temperature up to a threshold value. The optimum UV-C treatment temperature was 55°C, yielding a 58.9\% synergistic lethal effect. Under these treatment conditions, the UV-heat (UV-H55°C) lethal variability achieving 5-log reductions had a logistic distribution (α = 37.92, β = 1.10). Using this distribution, UV-H55°C doses to achieve the required juice safety goal with 95, 99, and 99.9\% confidence were 41.17, 42.97, and 46.00 J/ml, respectively, i.e., doses higher than the 37.58 J/ml estimated by a deterministic procedure. The public health impact of these results is that the larger UV-H55°C dose required for achieving 5-log reductions with 95, 99, and 99.9\% confidence would reduce the probability of hemolytic uremic syndrome in children by 76.3, 88.6, and 96.9\%, respectively. This study illustrates the importance of including the effect of data variability when selecting operational parameters for novel and conventional preservation processes to achieve high food safety standards with the desired confidence level.},

	abstract = {Fruit juices are an important source of bioactive compounds, but techniques used for their processing and subsequent storage may cause alterations in their contents so they do not provide the benefits expected by the consumer. In recent years consumers have increasingly sought so‐called “fresh” products (like fresh products), stored in refrigeration. This has led the food industry to develop alternative processing technologies to produce foods with a minimum of nutritional, physicochemical, or organoleptic changes induced by the technologies themselves. Attention has also focused on evaluating the microbiological or toxicological risks that may be involved in applying these processes, and their effect on food safety, in order to obtain safe products that do not present health risks. This concept of minimal processing is currently becoming a reality with conventional technologies (mild pasteurization) and nonthermal technologies, some recently introduced (pasteurization by high hydrostatic pressure) and some perhaps with a more important role in the future (pulsed electric fields). Nevertheless, processing is not the only factor that affects the quality of these products. It is also necessary to consider the conditions for refrigerated storage and to control time and temperature.},
